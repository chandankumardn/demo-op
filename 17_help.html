                <h4>HOW TO WRITE A MEMORIAL?</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Obitopedia is a global platform where people
                    and communities can celebrate the lives of
                    their departed ones by creating memorials,
                    by writing stories and tributes, by posting pic-
                    tures, audio and video, and by sharing them
                    with their loved ones—or with the world. It
                    was born out of the belief that everyone
                    deserves to have their life stories written
                    down and remembered.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    We're accustomed to seeing very few peo-
                    ple—mostly the wealthy and
                    well-known—publicly memorializing their dear
                    ones after death. At Obitopedia, we think that
                    societies should recognize everyone who live
                </p>


                <h4>WRITING OBITUARIES:AN EDITIONAL MEMO</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    While this is not something that Obitopedia will tell you in so many words how and what to write in a memorial, a broad memo, pre-pared for oneself, is below from the Founder's desktop. Treat it merely as a starting point to jog your mind, as opposed to a certain style sheet, which needs to be followed. At the end, it is a memorial that you would like to curate, and the ownership is with you. Obitopedia merely provides a platform.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Good memorial writings are invariably evoca-tive and poignant, with lively emotional quo-tient, and are fond snapshots of lives dear to
